# My Suckless Builds
This repo contains my builds for all of my suckless apps, which thus far is just [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) -- but have no fear, more builds are coming soon. I'm not a full time user of [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) or [st](https://st.suckless.org/), but I do have a build for both of those apps, which will be here as well. 

### Dmenu
My build of dmneu is focused on being as simple as possible, as of right now there is only one patch, the [center](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/center/) patch from Ed van Bruggen & Nihal Jere. This results in a dmenu build that functions something like the "Spotlight" app on OSX, except obviously with none of the functionality other than the app launcher.
