# My Suckless Builds
This repo contains my builds for all of my suckless apps, which thus far is just [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu) -- but have no fear, more builds are coming soon. I'm not a full time user of [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) or [st](https://st.suckless.org/), but I do have a build for both of those apps, which
 will be here as well.

### Dmenu
My build of dmneu is focused on being as simple as possible, as of right now there is only one patch, the [
center](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/center/) patch from Ed van Bruggen & Nihal Jere. Basically the idea is to have something that is vaguely aesthetically similar to *Spotlight* on MacOS, but also limited to being just an app launcher. As far as color schemes, this is basically [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox), but darkened, and de-saturated.
